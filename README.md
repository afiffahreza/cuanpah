## Background
Based on data from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 60% of waste is transported and dumped to landfills, 10% is recycled, while the other 30% is not managed and pollutes the environment. Every house or building in Indonesia also produces waste and 95% of it is plastic waste.  

We want to use our knowledge in technology to solve this problem by making Cuanpah, an application where users can take pictures of garbage/waste to sort and filter them, then the filtered and sorted waste will be picked up by a recycling company courier. Users will also earn points that can be traded with goods by using the application.
